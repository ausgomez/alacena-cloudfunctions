Hey, I am using this repo to build my cloud functions for my [Alacena - Recipe Explorer App](https://github.com/ausgomez/alacena-next-app).

Feel free to see how I set it up. Basically I am just adding a few node functions that you
can find under the `packages/cloud` folder that are the backend of my app.

I followed this [tutorial](https://docs.digitalocean.com/tutorials/create-a-jamstack-site-using-serverless-functions/#start-tutorial) to understand them.
